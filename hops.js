Despite claims to the contrary, it is identical to Canterbury Golding. The two names have been used interchangeably for some time. Canterbury is a town in East Kent and the hop was first brought to market there in 1790. Some, however, charge to this day that East Kent Golding and Cantebury Golding are two distinct varieties though there is no clear evidence to support this. The variety began to be known primarily as East Kent Golding in 1838.",
